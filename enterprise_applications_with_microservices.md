# Building Enterprise Applications with Microservices in the Cloud

## Introduction

For the past five decades, advances in information technology has driven the evolution of computers. Now they are everywhere: from mainframes to pacemakers; from the telephone network to carburettors. These technologies have enabled computers to supplement and often supplant other forms of services, including humans. In 2019, processor speed, storage capacity, and transmission rate are evolving at an annual rate of 60% (doubling every 18 months, or 100 times per decade) [correction and reference required].

This growth in technology has come to meet the needs of the current requirements for an information processor. Explosion in the amount of computational power needed for scientific calculations, dynamic visualisations, large scale and grand challenge applications has inspired numerous researches and created a challenge for cutting-edge technologies. With datasets growing beyond a few tens of terabytes, scientists have no off-the-shelf solutions that can be readily used to manage and analyse data.

The need for a distributed set of computational resources led to the introduction of cluster and grid computing, which promise to provide unlimited computational resources for high performance and high throughput applications through commodity (off-the-shelf) hardware.

One could argue the immaturity of distributed computing technology, however, their advantages cannot be overemphasised. Their importance are made clear by the fact that top companies have started leveraging them in how they build and deploy their applications. The availability of high-speed networks and increasingly powerful commodity microprocessors is making the usage of distributed computing appealing to most enterprises for a cost effective and an efficient computational power resource. 

As hardware distribution technology matures, it has become easy to scale software applications to multiple machines without regard to geographic restrictions. As machines become more distributed through clusters and grid technology, a naive approach to delivering software services is to run the same software on all machines and redirect traffic to machines that are free. This is called the monolithic style.

In 2014, a new pattern for developing enterprise applications began to emerge to leverage the advantage of distributing applications in a cluster. Microservices. The term "Microservices Architecture" has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services. While there is no exact definition of this development  style, there are certain common characteristics around how organisations are implementing it.

The Microservice Architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.

In summary, monolithic applications are built as a single unit. For example a monolithic webserver will handle HTTP requests, execute domain logic, retrieve and update data from the database, and select and populate HTML views to be sent to the browser. This is traditional approach to building applications. A monolith - a single logical executable. Any changes to the system involve building and deploying a new version of the webserver application.

On the other hand, the microservice architectural style involves building applications as a suite of services. Each service can be independently deployed and scaled. Each service is isolated and communication among them happens through a popular communication interface (often REST API). Each service can be written in a different programming language or managed by a different set of team, allowing for organisations to module software around business capabilities.
